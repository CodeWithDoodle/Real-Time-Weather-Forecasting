# Real-Time-Weather-Forecasting
Weather Prediction System that integrates real-time weather data with historical data to forecast weather conditions, such as temperature, humidity, and the probability of rain. This system provides valuable insights by combining live data from OpenWeatherMap with past weather records to make accurate predictions using machine learning models.

1. Objective of the Project
The main purpose of this project is to analyze weather conditions and provide predictions for future weather using a combination of:
âœ… Current weather data (fetched using OpenWeatherMap API)
âœ… Historical weather data (loaded from weather.csv)
âœ… Machine Learning (Random Forest models for classification & regression)
It aims to answer two key questions:
Will it rain tomorrow? (Classification Problem)
What will be the temperature & humidity in the next few hours? (Regression Problem)
This helps in weather forecasting and planning for different activities like agriculture, travel, and daily life.

2. How the Project Works?
The project consists of several interconnected steps, each responsible for handling different parts of weather prediction.
Step 1: Fetching Live Weather Data
â€¢	The project starts by asking the user to enter a city name.
â€¢	Once the city name is provided, the system fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
â€¢	This data includes: 
o	Temperature (Current, Min, Max) â€“ Helps understand current weather conditions.
o	Humidity Levels â€“ Important for predicting rainfall.
o	Wind Speed & Direction â€“ Wind data helps in forecasting weather changes.
o	Atmospheric Pressure â€“ Affects weather patterns like storms.
o	General Weather Conditions (Sunny, Cloudy, Rainy, etc.).
ðŸ“Œ Why is this important?
This real-time weather data serves as an input for the prediction model, ensuring that forecasts are up to date and accurate.

Step 2: Loading Historical Weather Data
â€¢	The project loads a dataset containing past weather records stored in weather.csv.
â€¢	This dataset contains several months or years of weather observations collected from different locations.
â€¢	The data is cleaned and pre-processed by: 
o	Removing duplicate records
o	Handling missing values
o	Converting textual information into machine-readable formats
ðŸ“Œ Why is this important?
Machine learning models require a lot of past data to learn patterns in weather conditions. The historical data helps train models to understand trends and predict future weather accurately.

Step 3: Processing and Preparing Data for Prediction
â€¢	Once the data is loaded, it is prepared for machine learning models.
â€¢	This involves selecting key weather parameters like:
o	Minimum & Maximum Temperature
o	Wind Speed and Direction
o	Humidity & Pressure
o	Previous Rainfall Data
â€¢	Some categorical variables like wind direction are converted into numerical values so they can be used for training models.
â€¢	The dataset is then split into features (inputs) and labels (outputs):
o	Inputs: Weather conditions from previous days.
o	Outputs: Rain occurrence (Yes/No) and future temperature/humidity values.
ðŸ“Œ Why is this important?
This step ensures that the machine learning model receives structured and meaningful data for training.

Step 4: Training the Rain Prediction Model (Classification)
â€¢	A Random Forest Classifier is used to train a model that predicts whether it will rain tomorrow.
â€¢	The model learns patterns based on past weather conditions and the occurrence of rain.
â€¢	Once trained, the model can analyze current weather conditions and predict the likelihood of rain for the next day.
ðŸ“Œ Why is this important?
This model is useful for weather forecasting applications, helping users prepare for rain in advance.

Step 5: Training the Temperature & Humidity Prediction Model (Regression)
â€¢	A Random Forest Regressor is used to predict future temperature and humidity.
â€¢	The model is trained on past temperature, humidity, and time-based trends.
â€¢	Once trained, it can forecast temperature and humidity for the next few hours or days based on current conditions.
ðŸ“Œ Why is this important?
Accurate temperature and humidity predictions help in planning agricultural activities, energy consumption, and outdoor events.

Step 6: Making Predictions for the Future
â€¢	After training, the models can make real-time predictions based on the most recent weather data.
â€¢	The system uses the trained models to predict: 
o	Whether it will rain tomorrow (Yes/No)
o	Temperature for the next 5 hours
o	Humidity levels for the next 5 hours
ðŸ“Œ Why is this important?
This provides users with a realistic forecast of upcoming weather conditions, improving decision-making for travel, farming, and city planning.

Step 7: Displaying Results
â€¢	The final step is to display all relevant weather details, including: 
o	Current Weather (fetched from OpenWeatherMap)
o	Past Weather Data Insights
o	Rain Prediction for Tomorrow
o	Temperature & Humidity Forecast for the Next 5 Hours
ðŸ“Œ Why is this important?
This combines real-time data, historical trends, and AI-powered predictions into one system, providing an easy-to-understand weather forecast for users.

3. Why Does This Project Use Both Real-Time & Historical Data?
The combination of live weather data and historical records makes the predictions more accurate and reliable.
ðŸ”¹ Real-time Data (from OpenWeatherMap API)
â€¢	Ensures that the system gets current weather conditions.
â€¢	Helps in making instant predictions about upcoming weather.
ðŸ”¹ Historical Data (from weather.csv)
â€¢	Provides a large dataset for training machine learning models.
â€¢	Helps the models understand long-term weather patterns.
By combining real-time observations with past trends, the system adapts to changing weather conditions and makes better forecasts.

4. Real-World Applications of Your Project
âœ… Weather Forecasting Apps â€“ Improve weather prediction accuracy.
âœ… Agriculture Planning â€“ Farmers can plan irrigation and crops based on rainfall predictions.
âœ… Travel & Logistics â€“ Helps airlines, shipping, and transport services adjust schedules.
